3. In a comment, explain the running times of the HashList methods in the best-case scenario
in which there are no collisions, and in the worst-case scenario in which there are many
collisions.
  - HashList method takes constant running time or O(1) in both best-case and worse-case scenerio
  - hashfunction method also takes constant running time or O(1) in both best-case and worse-case scenerio
  - put method takes constant running time or O(1) for best-case scenerio with no collision and linear running time 
  or O(n) for worse case scenerio with collisions
  - contain method also takes constant running time or O(1) for best-case scenerio with no collision and linear 
  running time or O(n) for worse case scenerio with collisions items method takes constant running time or O(1) in 
  both best-case and worse-case scenerio
4. Also explain how we would have to modify things to convert our HashList into a dictionary.

First, we will have to use two lists in order to create a hash table for the dictionary. 
The first list can be the slots of the data from the HashList, which will be the key for that corresponding data. 
The second list can be the data values. When we look up a key, the corresponding position in the data list will 
hold the associated data value.
